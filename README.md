# Benchmark Dataset: Unsupervised Denoising at the Atomic Scale


The dataset contains instances of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in-situ movies of 1 - 5 nm Pt metal nanoparticles sitting on a cerium oxide support. A total of 18,597 frames are used. The experimental data was recorded at room temperature at a pressure of $\sim10-6$ Torr. The electron beam intensity is $600e/A^2/s$. The instances are part of 23 videos, taken at a frame rate of 75 frames per second. The instances show Pt particles in the size range 1 - 5 nm. In a subset of frame series, the particles become unstable and undergo structural dynamic re-arrangements.  The periods of instability are punctuated by periods of relative stability.  Consequently the nanoparticles show a variety of different sizes and shapes and are also viewed along many different crystallographic directions. Data was collected using a FEI Titan ETEM in EFTEM mode, Gatan Tantalum hot stage, K3 camera in CDS counting mode.

There are 25 different videos and each video may show up to 10 Pt nanoparticles in each frame, with a total of $18,759$ frames.

The dataset consists of in situ movies taken of Pt/CeO2 catalyst at room temperature and at 200 °C in vacuum, pure CO and mixed CO-O2 gas atmospheres. The movies consist of 75 fps time-series of 3.4k x 3.4k images captured over 5–15 seconds. They were captured using FEI Titan ETEM in EFTEM mode, Gatan Tantalum hot stage and a K3 camera in CDS mode.
